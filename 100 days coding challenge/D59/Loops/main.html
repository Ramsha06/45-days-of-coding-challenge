//1. What is the last value alerted by this code? Why?

let i = 3;

while (i) {
  alert( i-- );
}


==>Every loop iteration decreases i by 1. The check while(i) stops the loop when i = 0.

Hence, the steps of the loop form the following sequence (“loop unrolled”):

let i = 3;

alert(i--); // shows 3, decreases i to 2

alert(i--) // shows 2, decreases i to 1

alert(i--) // shows 1, decreases i to 0

// done, while(i) check stops the loop



//2. For every loop iteration, write down which value it outputs and then compare it with the solution.

Both loops alert the same values, or not?

//   1 => The prefix form ++i:

let i = 0;
while (++i < 5) alert( i ); // 1
                            // 2
                            // 3
                            // 4
    


//  2 =>The postfix form i++


let i = 0;
while (i++ < 5) alert( i );     // 1
                                // 2
                                // 3
                                // 4
                                // 5

// 3. Which values get shown by the "for" loop?
importance: 4
For each loop write down which values it is going to show. Then compare with the answer.

Both loops alert same values or not?

=> The postfix form:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i ); // 0
                                        // 1
                                        // 2
                                        // 3
                                        // 4



=> The prefix form:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i ); // 0
                                        // 1
                                        // 2
                                        // 3
                                        // 4


//4. Use the for loop to output even numbers from 2 to 10.

for (let i=2;  i <=10 ; i++)
{
   if(i %2 == 0)
   {
    alert(i);
   }
    
}

//5. Replace "for" with "while"
importance: 5
Rewrite the code changing the for loop to while without altering its behavior (the output should stay same).

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  alert( `number ${i}!` );
}


=> in   while

let i =0;
while(i < 3){
    alert (`number ${i}`);
    i++;
}


//6.   Repeat until the input is correct
importance: 5
Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.

The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.

Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.


let num;

do {
  num = prompt("Enter a number greater than 100?", 0);
} while (num <= 100 && num);

//7. Output prime numbers
importance: 3
An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.

In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.

For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.

Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.

For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.

P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value.
